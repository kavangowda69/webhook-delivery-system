# Multi-User Webhook Delivery System

A production-style webhook infrastructure built with **FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker**.

The system allows users to register webhook endpoints, subscribe to platform events, and receive event payloads asynchronously through a **reliable, rate-limited, and fair delivery pipeline**.

This project demonstrates how modern backend systems implement **event-driven webhook delivery at scale**, similar to platforms like Stripe, Shopify, and GitHub.

# Assignment Coverage

This project implements all three required parts of the assignment:

### Part A — Core Delivery
- Webhook CRUD API
- Event ingestion endpoint
- Delivery worker
- Mock receiver service
- Fully containerized system using Docker Compose

### Part B — Rate Limiting
- Global delivery rate limit
- Runtime configuration endpoint
- Queued delivery when rate capacity is exceeded

### Part C — Multi-User Fairness
- Fair scheduling across users
- One user flooding events does not block others

# System Overview

The system supports three event types:

```
request.created
request.updated
request.deleted
```

Users can subscribe webhooks to any combination of these events.

The platform workflow:

1. Users register webhook endpoints
2. Applications publish events
3. The system fans out deliveries to subscribed webhooks
4. Delivery workers send HTTP POST requests to each endpoint

Event delivery is **asynchronous and queue-based** to ensure scalability and reliability.

# Features

## Webhook Registration

Users can register webhook endpoints and subscribe them to event types.

Example:

```
POST /webhooks
```

Request body:

```
{
  "url": "http://receiver:9000/webhook",
  "event_types": ["request.created", "request.updated"]
}
```

---

## Webhook CRUD API

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|------|------|------|
| POST | /webhooks | Register webhook |
| GET | /webhooks | List webhooks |
| PUT | /webhooks/{id} | Update webhook |
| DELETE | /webhooks/{id} | Delete webhook |
| POST | /webhooks/{id}/enable | Enable webhook |
| POST | /webhooks/{id}/disable | Disable webhook |

Disabled webhooks do not receive deliveries.

---

## Event Ingestion

Applications publish events through:

```
POST /events
```

Example:

```
{
  "user_id": "123",
  "event_type": "request.created",
  "payload": {
    "request_id": 42
  }
}
```

The system:

1. Finds active webhooks for the user
2. Filters by event type
3. Creates delivery jobs
4. Pushes them to Redis

---

# Queue-Based Delivery

Webhook deliveries are **not performed synchronously**.

Instead, the API pushes delivery jobs to **Redis**, which acts as a message queue.

Example job:

```
{
  "webhook_id": 1,
  "user_id": "123",
  "target_url": "http://receiver:9000/webhook",
  "event_type": "request.created",
  "payload": {...}
}
```

This architecture provides:

- Non-blocking API responses
- Reliable delivery processing
- Scalable worker-based architecture

---

# Delivery Worker

The worker service continuously processes delivery jobs.

Workflow:

1. Pop job from Redis queue
2. Respect global rate limit
3. Select next job based on fairness scheduler
4. Send HTTP POST request
5. Log success or failure

A delivery is considered successful when the webhook endpoint responds with **HTTP 2xx**.

Failed deliveries are logged (retry logic intentionally out of scope per assignment requirements).

---

# Rate Limiting (Part B)

The system implements a **global delivery rate limit**.

Example:

```
10 deliveries per second
```

If events arrive faster than the allowed rate:

- deliveries remain queued in Redis
- workers process them gradually as capacity becomes available

### Runtime Rate Limit Configuration

The system exposes an internal endpoint:

```
GET /rate-limit
POST /rate-limit
```

Example update:

```
{
  "limit_per_second": 20
}
```

This allows rate limits to be changed **without restarting the system**.

---

# Multi-User Fairness (Part C)

To prevent a single user from monopolizing the delivery pipeline, the system implements **fair scheduling across users**.

### Problem

If User A publishes thousands of events, they could block deliveries for other users.

### Solution

The worker uses **per-user queues with round-robin scheduling**.

Instead of processing a single global queue, deliveries are scheduled by user:

```
User A queue
User B queue
User C queue
```

The worker cycles between users:

```
A → B → C → A → B → C
```

This ensures:

- heavy users cannot block others
- smaller workloads are delivered quickly
- delivery latency remains consistent across users

# Running the System

The entire system starts with one command:

```
docker compose up --build
```

This launches:

- API service
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Worker service
- Mock webhook receiver
